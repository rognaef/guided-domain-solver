    "# Question:     Can you give me a instruction set in the format \"[RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT, UP, LEFT, UP]\" to solve this Sokoban game?\n",
    "# Attachment:   <Picture of start enviroment>\n",
    "# Answer:       Thought for 5m 23s\n",
    "#               First, a quick note on why this is tricky: Sokoban puzzles are easiest to solve (and to give precise move sequences for) when we have a clear, text‐based grid or coordinate layout. In a single screenshot—especially a stylized one—it can be hard to be 100% certain where each box and target sits (some boxes may already be on top of goals, or the puzzle may have “hidden” goals under boxes). Nonetheless, we can still outline a plausible solution sequence by carefully interpreting the image.\n",
    "#               1. Interpreting the Puzzle from the Image\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#               From your screenshot:\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#                   Green alien = the player’s position.\n",
    "#                   Gold squares with “X” = boxes/crates to be pushed.\n",
    "#                   Red squares with a “+” = goal squares (some might be under boxes already).\n",
    "#                   Black floor = walkable area.\n",
    "#                   Brick area = walls (impassable).\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#               It appears there are 4 boxes and 4 goals arranged roughly in a cluster. The player (green alien) starts somewhere near the center of the walkable area, with boxes around it (top-left, top-right, and at least two below). Three of the red “+” goals are clearly visible; the fourth may be underneath a box. Typically in Sokoban, the number of boxes equals the number of goals.\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#               A likely arrangement (simplified) might be something like:\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#                  +---+---+---+---+\n",
    "#                  |Box|Box|    |   |  <-- Possibly 2 boxes on the top row,\n",
    "#                  +---+---+---+---+      with a goal or two near themü\n",
    "#                        |\n",
    "#                        | (Green Alien somewhere here)\n",
    "#                        |\n",
    "#                  +---+---+---+---+\n",
    "#                  |Box|   |Box|Goal|  <-- More boxes and goals in the lower rows\n",
    "#                  +---+---+---+---+\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#               (Exact squares can differ, but this is roughly what the screenshot suggests.)\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#               Your task is to push each gold “X” onto a red “+”. We just need to route the alien behind each box in the correct order and push it onto its goal.\n",
    "#               2. A Possible Step-by-Step Solution\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#               Below is an example move sequence in pure cardinal directions—UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n",
    "#               Whenever the alien moves into a box from behind, it pushes the box one step in that same direction (assuming the space beyond the box is free).\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#                   Important: Because we do not have a perfectly clear textual grid, the exact route might differ slightly on your end—especially if a wall blocks one of these paths or if a box is already on a goal. Treat this sequence as a template for how you might solve it. If any step is blocked, you may need to “walk around” an extra step or two, but the overall push order should be similar.\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#               High-Level Strategy\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#                   Push the top-left box onto its goal (which might be just one or two moves away).\n",
    "#                   Push the top-right box onto the goal to the right.\n",
    "#                   Push any box(es) below upward or sideways onto their goals.\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#               Example Move List\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#               Here is a generic 8-move sequence in the requested bracketed format (just as an illustration).\n",
    "#               It assumes you can walk around freely to line up behind each box:\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#               [RIGHT, RIGHT,  DOWN, \n",
    "#                LEFT,  LEFT,   UP, \n",
    "#                LEFT,  UP]\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#                   Moves 1–2 (RIGHT, RIGHT): Alien walks/pushes the right‐side box onto its goal (if that box is directly to your right).\n",
    "#                   Move 3 (DOWN): Move down (possibly getting around a box or positioning for the next push).\n",
    "#                   Moves 4–5 (LEFT, LEFT): Alien heads left to get behind another box.\n",
    "#                   Move 6 (UP): Moves up behind that box.\n",
    "#                   Moves 7–8 (LEFT, UP): Final pushes or repositioning for the bottom boxes.\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#               In an actual Sokoban grid, you might need a few more “filler” steps (like stepping around a corner: DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT, UP) to get behind the next box without accidentally pushing it the wrong way. So if your puzzle blocks you at any point, just add the extra single‐step moves needed to walk around walls or boxes.\n",
    "#               3. Tailoring It to Your Exact Layout\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#               If the above sequence does not match perfectly, the core idea is:\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#                   Walk behind the box you want to move.\n",
    "#                   Push it onto its nearby goal (by moving in the direction of the goal).\n",
    "#                   Navigate around the other boxes (without shoving them into corners!) to line up each subsequent push.\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#               In other words, you only ever list simple moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Whenever your character steps into a box’s square, that box is pushed one tile in the same direction (assuming it’s free).\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#               If you discover that, say, you need to go around a box to reach another, just insert the extra “walk around” steps in the same bracket format. For instance:\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#               [RIGHT,  RIGHT,  DOWN,  DOWN, \n",
    "#                LEFT,   LEFT,   UP,    UP, \n",
    "#                RIGHT,  PUSH,   ...]\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#               and so on—adjusting as needed.\n",
    "#               4. Final Notes\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#                   Sokoban solutions can vary (there can be more than one valid sequence).\n",
    "#                   If your layout differs, adapt these directions accordingly.\n",
    "#                   The key is always to avoid pushing a box into a corner or against a wall unless that wall square is actually a goal.\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#               With that in mind, try a sequence like:\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#               [RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT, LEFT, UP, LEFT, UP]\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#               as a starting template. If you need extra single steps to walk around obstructions, just slot them in. You’ll end up with a bracketed list of 8–12 moves (or so) that solves your specific arrangement.\n",
    "#               \n",
    "#               Good luck, and happy Sokoban solving!\n",

    "#               \n",
