The Sokoban environment has a player at [1,1], and there's a box at [2,1]. The goal is to move the box to the target, which is at [3,1]. The shortest path for the box is to go right. But the box is already at [2,1], so moving it right would place it on the target. Wait, the box is at [2,1], and the target is at [3,1]. So the box needs to move right once to reach the target. But the player is at [1,1]. To push the box right, the player needs to be to the left of the box. Since the box is at [2,1], the player is at [1,1], which is directly left. So the player can move right into the box, pushing it to [3,1], which is the target. That would complete the level. The possible action here is 'Right', so the next action should be RIGHT.\n</think>"}, response_metadata={'model': 'qwen3:8b', 'created_at': '2025-07-12T13:45:40.905683Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 48355852100, 'load_duration': 25497500, 'prompt_eval_count': 295, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1668344500, 'eval_count': 220, 'eval_duration': 46659174300, 'model_name': 'qwen3:8b'}, id='run--76d65138-b2b9-4fba-b1c2-38e65c45c5be-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 295, 'output_tokens': 220, 'total_tokens': 515})]
