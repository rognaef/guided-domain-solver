The Sokoban environment has a player at position (1,3) and a box at (1,2). The goal is to move the box to a target. The shortest path for the box is to go left. Wait, the box is already at (1,2), and the target is at (1,1) since the first record has has_box_target True and caption Floor [1,1]. So the box needs to move left from (1,2) to (1,1). But the player is at (1,3). To push the box left, the player needs to be to the right of the box. So the player should move left to (1,2), then push the box left to (1,1). But the possible actions now are only Left. Wait, the player is at (1,3), so moving left would take them to (1,2), which is where the box is. Wait, no. Wait, the player is at (1,3), and the box is at (1,2). So if the player moves left, they would go to (1,2), but that's where the box is. Wait, no. Wait, in Sokoban, the player can move into adjacent cells. If the player is at (1,3) and moves left, they go to (1,2), which is the box's position. But since the box is there, moving left would push the box further left to (1,1) if possible. Wait, but the box is at (1,2). If the player moves left, they would push the box left to (1,1), which is the target. So the action should be LEFT. But the possible actions listed are only Left. So the correct action is LEFT.\n</think>"}, response_metadata={'model': 'qwen3:8b', 'created_at': '2025-07-29T16:55:55.8889465Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 90616804700, 'load_duration': 27040600, 'prompt_eval_count': 290, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1704636400, 'eval_count': 385, 'eval_duration': 88882284000, 'model_name': 'qwen3:8b'}, id='run--887a9a8e-6dca-4b08-bf54-e1624a35565b-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 290, 'output_tokens': 385, 'total_tokens': 675})]
