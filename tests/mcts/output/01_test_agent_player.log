The Sokoban game environment has a player at position (1,3). There\'s a box at (1,2) which is on a floor tile, not on a target. The target is at (1,1), which is a floor tile. The shortest path to place the box is to move left. Since the player is at (1,3), moving left would take them to (1,2), which is where the box is. Wait, but the box is already there. Wait, maybe the path is to push the box from (1,2) to (1,1), which is the target. But the player is at (1,3). To push the box left, the player needs to be to the right of the box. So the player is at (1,3), box at (1,2). If the player moves left, they go to (1,2), then push the box left to (1,1). But the shortest path to place is "LEFT", which might mean the player should move left to push. Wait, the possible actions here are \'Left\'. So the player can move left, which would push the box from (1,2) to (1,1), placing it on the target. That\'s the correct move. So the action should be LEFT.\n</think>'}, response_metadata={'model': 'qwen3:8b', 'created_at': '2025-07-30T12:31:22.7933177Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 3327566500, 'load_duration': 30108800, 'prompt_eval_count': 290, 'prompt_eval_duration': 109181200, 'eval_count': 285, 'eval_duration': 3177580000, 'model_name': 'qwen3:8b'}, id='run--0a3ed3f9-1d2d-4ad2-bcfa-2e8e2519982f-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 290, 'output_tokens': 285, 'total_tokens': 575})]
