The Sokoban environment has a player at position (1,3) and a box at (1,2). The goal is to move the box to a target. The shortest path for the box is to go left. Wait, the box is already at (1,2), and the target is at (1,1) since that's the only target mentioned. So the box needs to move left to (1,1). But the player is at (1,3). To push the box left, the player needs to be to the right of the box. So the player should move left to position (1,2), then push the box left to (1,1). But the current possible action is 'Left' for the player. So moving left from (1,3) to (1,2) would put the player next to the box. Then, pushing the box left would require the player to move left again. But the current step is to choose the next action. Since the player can only move left now, they should do that to get next to the box. Then the next step would be to push. But the current action is the first move. So the correct action here is LEFT.\n</think>"}, response_metadata={'model': 'qwen3:8b', 'created_at': '2025-07-22T15:41:19.9175433Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 64139552800, 'load_duration': 26428700, 'prompt_eval_count': 295, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1864197900, 'eval_count': 262, 'eval_duration': 62243199800, 'model_name': 'qwen3:8b'}, id='run--cee1d341-cf0a-4e78-b58b-f496545db0e9-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 295, 'output_tokens': 262, 'total_tokens': 557})]
