The Sokoban environment has a player at position (1,3) and a box at (1,2). The goal is to move the box to a target. The shortest path for the box is to go left. Since the box is at (1,2), moving left would take it to (1,1), which is a target. But the player is at (1,3). To push the box left, the player needs to be to the right of the box. Wait, the box is at (1,2), so the player is at (1,3), which is to the right. So the player can move left into the box, pushing it left. But the possible action here is 'Left' for the player. So moving left would push the box from (1,2) to (1,1), which is the target. That should complete the level. So the correct action is LEFT.\n</think>"}, response_metadata={'model': 'qwen3:8b', 'created_at': '2025-07-17T14:05:51.658483Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 2468506300, 'load_duration': 12821300, 'prompt_eval_count': 295, 'prompt_eval_duration': 7480000, 'eval_count': 203, 'eval_duration': 2439950600, 'model_name': 'qwen3:8b'}, id='run--8ba37d07-eb91-4bf6-8e89-666a0cdff3b1-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 295, 'output_tokens': 203, 'total_tokens': 498})]
