The Sokoban game environment has a player at position (1,3) [since the caption is 'Player', y=1, x=3]. The box is at (1,2) with caption 'Box [2,1]', and the target is at (1,1) which has 'has_box_target': True. The shortest path to place the box is 'LEFT', which would move the box from x=2 to x=1. But the player is at x=3. So the player needs to move left to push the box. Wait, the possible actions here are only 'Left'. So if the player moves left, they would go to x=2, which is where the box is. Then pushing the box left would require the player to move left again, but the box is already at x=2. Wait, maybe the player is at x=3, and the box is at x=2. So moving left would push the box to x=1, which is the target. But the shortest path says 'LEFT', so the action should be LEFT. But the possible actions are only Left. So the correct action is LEFT.\n</think>"}, response_metadata={'model': 'qwen3:8b', 'created_at': '2025-08-08T08:15:19.7546782Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 2962732100, 'load_duration': 25149200, 'prompt_eval_count': 290, 'prompt_eval_duration': 16845800, 'eval_count': 251, 'eval_duration': 2919181100, 'model_name': 'qwen3:8b'}, id='run--bfd59415-2984-43ee-ad3f-3235d50bb884-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 290, 'output_tokens': 251, 'total_tokens': 541})]
