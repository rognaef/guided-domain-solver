The goal is to move the box to the target. From the records, the player is at position (1,3), and there's a box at (1,2). The target is at (1,1), which is marked as having a box target. The shortest path for the box is to go left. Wait, the box is already at (1,2), and the target is at (1,1). So the box needs to move left to reach the target. But the player is at (1,3). The possible action here is left. If the player moves left, they would go to (1,2), which is where the box is. Then, pushing the box left would move it to (1,1), which is the target. But the current possible action listed is left. Wait, the player can move left to push the box. So the correct action here is LEFT. That would push the box into the target position.
