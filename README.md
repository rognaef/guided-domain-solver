# VM Code Generation with Knowledge Graph

Code Generation with Knowledge Graph project is an approach to automating software development by leveraging the power of multi-agent systems and knowledge graphs. This project aims to generate code by enabling multiple intelligent agents to collaboratively generate, optimize, and validate code based on a structured knowledge graph that captures domain-specific information.
